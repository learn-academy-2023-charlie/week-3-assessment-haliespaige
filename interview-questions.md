# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is an extension of JavaScript that allows us to combine JavaScript and HTML in React and render it to the DOM.

Researched answer: JSX, also know as JavaScript XML, is a syntex extension of JavaScript. This form of markup enables us to convert HTML into react elements, combine HTML with JavaScript and render it to the DOM. Utilizing JSX allows us to write cleaner code that is easier to understand and edit. 

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn: Yet Another Resource Neogtiator. Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that pulls all the necessary resources to create functionality.  

Researched answer: Yarn automates the process of installing, updating, configuring and removing pieces of software (packages) retreived from a global registry. Yarn still relies on modules from the npm registry but acts as a new installer. Yarn has the power to perform multiple installation steps at once which speeds up the process. 

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A React component is an independent and reusable chunk of code. It is best practice to store these components in separate files in order to help us identify and fix bugs easier without breaking our entire application. 

Researched answer: There are two types of React components, Class components and Function components. The component name is in PascalCase, meaning it must start with an upper case letter. We can share the data in each component between other components. 

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values are used to store data we know will be modified. Props pass data and they are read only and cannot be modified. 

Researched answer: 
State holds information about the component and is Mutable.
Props can pass properties from parent components to child components and are Immutable

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the visual representation of your code on the browser.

Researched answer: The DOM is an application programming interface, meaning we use the DOM when we interact with web pages. We can add, delete and change content of a HTML document. 
 
6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: A div tag acts as a container for a chunk of code to provide separation from other chucks of code. 
A span tag is used to target a specific piece of code, only within the span tag. 

Researched answer: 
A div tag is a block-level element which always starts on a new line and the browser automatically adds margins before and after the element. A div element defines a division or section of code. 
A span tag is an inline element which does not start on a new line. An inline element cannont contain a block-level element but a block-level element can contain an inline element. 


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: A computer programming model that organizes software around data or objects rather than functions and logic. 
4 pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism

2. Ruby: A pure object-oriented programming language. Apparently it's syntax is cleaner and easier - we will see! 

3. Implicit return: A way to return values without using the return keyword. It is Optional and used for shortening code. 

4. Ruby blocks: Anonymous functions that can be passed into methods. Blocks are enclosed in do-end statements or curly braces.
    do-end is usually for blocks that spans multiple lines white curly braces are used for single line blocks. 
    It seems like this is similar to the compare function that can be passed into methods ((a,b) => a+b) ?

5. Ruby hashes: A data structure that allows us to store data in unique key-value pairs. Acts as a dictionary of values.
